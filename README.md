# Predicting_March_Madness
This is our team's final project entry for the 2023 March Madness Data Crunch annual competition hosted by Fordham Business School and sponsored by Deloitte. 

The goal is to predict the NCAA Men's Basketball March Madness tournament bracket using statistical and machine learning techniques. Each team is given the same historical data set for training, but can incorporate any new feature data, feature selection, and modeling testing and training techniques to improve model performance. 

Our team won 1st place for creative use of data in identifying new features and model accuracy (0.49 log loss). We identified, cleaned, and incorporated three new features which improved performance:
  team_revenue: revenue generated by men's basketball team
  team_expenses: men's basketball team expenses
  star_player_rating: individual top scorer's avg. points per game proportion of team's avg. points per game
